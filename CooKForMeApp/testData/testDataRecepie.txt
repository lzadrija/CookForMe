Arrange fattiest side up, so while the lamb is cooking the fat will melt into the meat. Place directly on middle rack of the oven, with a roasting pan on a separate rack a rung lower, to catch the drippings. You may also want to put some water (a cup or so) in the bottom roasting pan, so that the drippings fall into the water instead of burning in the hot pan and smoking up your kitchen. Roast at 425°F for 40 minutes.

Easy Poached Eggs 
000019
Breakfast
Ingredients
Egg_2 pieces, Salt_a pinch, Vinegar_2 teaspoons
First bring water in a saucepan to almost boiling. If the water is already boiling, lower the heat until it is no longer boiling. At this point, you can add one or two teaspoons of vinegar to the water, if you want. The vinegar will help the egg whites to congeal more easily. Working with the eggs one by one, crack an egg into a small cup, then place the cup near the surface of the hot water and gently drop the egg into the water. With a spoon, nudge the eggwhites closer to their yolks. This will help the egg whites hold together. Turn off the heat. Cover. Let sit for 4 minutes, until the egg whites are cooked. Lift eggs out of pan with a slotted spoon.

Beer Can Chicken
000021
Lunch
Supper
Ingredients
Chicken_1 pound, Olive oil_2 tablespoons, Beer_1/2 can, Salt_1 tablespoon, Thyme_2 tablespoons, Pepper_1 tablespoon
Prepare your grill for indirect heat. Rub the chicken all over with olive oil. Mix the salt, pepper, and thyme in a little bowl, then sprinkle it all over the chicken. Lower the chicken on to the open can, so that the chicken is sitting upright, with the can in its cavity. Place the chicken on the cool side of the grill, using the legs and beer can as a tripod to support the chicken on the grill and keep it stable. Keep checking the chicken every 15 minutes or so, until cooked. The total cooking time will vary depending on the size of your chicken. Carefully transfer the chicken to a tray or pan. I say "carefully" because the beer can, and the beer inside of it, is quite hot. One way to do this is to slide a metal spatula under the bottom of the beer can. Use tongs to hold the top of the chicken. Lift the chicken, beer can still inside, and move it to a tray. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes. Carefully lift the chicken off of the can.
